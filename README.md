### Choose and use one best template engine from course. Also mention reason why you selected that particular template engine in README of github project.

I chose ejs for the template engine beacuse of the following reasons:
a. Familiarity: As EJS uses JavaScript syntax, developers who are proficient in JavaScript can quickly adapt to EJS and integrate it into their projects.
b. Flexibility: EJS's direct JavaScript integration allows for dynamic content generation and complex logic execution within templates.
c. Client-Side Rendering: EJS templates can be rendered both on the server-side and the client-side, offering versatility in implementation.
